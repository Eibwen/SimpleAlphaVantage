# Simple Alpha Vantage client

I was not totally happy with the Alpha Vantage clients I found for C#, and thought building my own would be a fun task.

### Goals
* Clean and simple interface
* Minimal 3rd party dependencies
* Simple to implement and expand on supported endpoints
* Typed response objects
